# Official Cloud Icons

CloudIcons is a Blazor WebAssembly application that lets you download official icons for Azure, AWS, and GCP in SVG and PNG formats. The app is now hosted as a static web application on GitHub Pages.

🌐 **Live Demo**: [https://mjtpena.github.io/cloudicons/](https://mjtpena.github.io/cloudicons/)

## Features

- Download official icons for Azure, AWS, and GCP
- Choose between SVG and PNG formats
- Browse icons easily with a user-friendly interface
- Search and filter icons by name
- Copy images to clipboard for quick use
- Fast loading with pre-generated metadata

## Icon Sources

The catalog is refreshed from official provider packages. The dates below describe the newest package/update published by each provider; some providers publish rolling downloads without version numbers.

| Provider | Official source | Package represented in this catalog |
| --- | --- | --- |
| AWS | [AWS Architecture Icons](https://aws.amazon.com/architecture/icons/) | July 31, 2026 package |
| Azure | [Azure Architecture Icons](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/icons/) | Version 24, July 2026 |
| Google Cloud | [Google Cloud Icon Library](https://cloud.google.com/icons) | Current core and category icons, plus the official legacy set (new iconography announced in 2025) |
| Microsoft Entra | [Entra architecture icons](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/architecture/architecture-icons) | October 2023 package, the latest linked by Microsoft |
| Microsoft Fabric | [Fabric icons](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/fundamentals/icons) | Official Fabric samples package, version 6.1.0 |
| Microsoft 365 | [Microsoft 365 architecture icons](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/microsoft-365/solutions/architecture-icons-templates) | 2024 package, the latest linked by Microsoft |
| Power Platform | [Power Platform icons](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/guidance/icons) | December 2025 update |
| Dynamics 365 | [Dynamics 365 icons](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/get-started/icons) | February 2026 update |

### Updating the icon catalog

Run `bash update-icons.sh` to download the official packages, validate and stage all eight provider sets, replace the local assets, and regenerate their metadata. The script requires `curl`, `unzip`, and Python 3 (`python3`, or `python` on Windows); it leaves the existing catalog untouched if a download, archive check, extraction, or metadata generation fails.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- .NET 8.0 or later
- Visual Studio 2019 or later (or VS Code)

### Installation

1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mjtpena/cloudicons.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory
```bash
cd cloudicons
```

3. Restore dependencies
```bash
dotnet restore
```

4. Run the project
```bash
dotnet run
```

## Building for Production

### GitHub Pages Deployment

This project is configured for automatic deployment to GitHub Pages. The deployment happens automatically when changes are pushed to the `main` branch via GitHub Actions.

#### Manual Build for GitHub Pages

To build the static files for GitHub Pages deployment manually:

```bash
dotnet publish -c Release -o ./dist
```

The output will be in `./dist/wwwroot/cloudicons/` with the correct base path configured for GitHub Pages subpath deployment.

#### Local Development

For local development, use:

```bash
dotnet run
```

This will start the development server at `https://localhost:5001` (or similar).

## Usage

1. Navigate to the live demo or run locally
2. Select an icon provider from the navigation menu (Azure, AWS, GCP, etc.)
3. Use the search box to find specific icons
4. Click "Download SVG" to download the vector format
5. Check "Download as PNG" and click the link to download as PNG
6. Right-click on any icon to copy it to clipboard

## Technology

- **Frontend**: Blazor WebAssembly (.NET 8)
- **Hosting**: GitHub Pages (Static)
- **Icons**: 7,818 official cloud service icons
- **Build**: GitHub Actions for CI/CD

## Deployment

### GitHub Pages Deployment

The application is automatically deployed to GitHub Pages using GitHub Actions:

1. **Automatic Deployment**: Every push to the `main` branch triggers the deployment workflow
2. **Workflow**: The `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` workflow handles:
   - Building the .NET 8 Blazor WebAssembly application
   - Configuring the base path for GitHub Pages subpath (`/cloudicons/`)
   - Adding the `.nojekyll` file for proper asset serving
   - Deploying to GitHub Pages

### Manual Deployment Steps

If you need to deploy manually or troubleshoot:

1. Ensure the repository has GitHub Pages enabled in Settings → Pages
2. Set the source to "GitHub Actions"
3. The workflow will automatically handle deployment on push to `main`

### Local Testing of Production Build

To test the production build locally:

```bash
dotnet publish -c Release -o ./dist
# Serve the ./dist/wwwroot/cloudicons/ directory with a static file server
```

Note: The production build includes the `/cloudicons/` base path configuration for GitHub Pages.
